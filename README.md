# SiMineCraft 
***A Hard Fork of SimonDev's Minecraft Clone 2***

## History

SimonDev makes really interesting video tutorials on YouTube. In a couple of them he's recreated basic Minecraft functionality, using Three.js. His latest one is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQt0exToUEY Along with the video he released the code at: https://github.com/simondevyoutube/Quick_MinecraftClone2

While this is an amazing collection of code, it has been in a broken state for a while due to Chrome updates. This "simine-craft" repo is meant to fix bugs, provide a playable link, and potentially add additional functionality.
